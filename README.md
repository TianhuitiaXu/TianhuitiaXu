👋 Hi, I’m @TianhuitiaXu  
  
👀 I’m interested in **Computational Electromagnetics**, **Applied Machine Learning**, **Signal Processing**, and **Nanotechnology**.  
  
🌱 I’m currently working on Spacetime-Varying Metasurface. My previous work on [Biosensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14118 "Detection of Single-base Mismatches in DNA Sequences by using Electrochemically-gated Graphene Microwave Waveguides").  
  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects regarding  
- Numerical Simulation Techniques for **Spacetime-Varying** Media and Devices
- Signal Processing and Data Analysis for **Electrical/Chemical/Optical** Sensors for Healthcare/Imaging.
- Machine Learning for Music Information Retrieval and Music Arranging and Mixing.
- ...
